# Camera
It's being developed as my summer project along with two other apps. It is not yet finished and needs a lot of polishing, but I really do believe that it's better implemented (camera controller itself, not ui implementation) than what you'll find in over half of the AVFoundation tutorials out there.

## About the project
It is a camera app that pretty much does what every camera app should do. You can take pictures, record videos, and even record videos while swapping cameras (something like in Snapchat), although this feature is not fully implemented yet. The camera controller also allows you to zoom in and out, flip cameras, turn the flash on and off, focus, save recorded resources, and everything was written from scratch using mostly AVFoundation with a small touch of UIKit, as AVFoundation lacks support SwiftUI.
